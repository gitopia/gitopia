[Gitopia](https://gitopia.com/) is a platform for developers and web3 communities to collaborate on open-source projects in a decentralized and censorship-free environment by using permanent storage through Filecoin, Arweave, and IPFS. Additionally, it offers web3-specific features such as Bounties and Proposals, which Gitopia supports through its native LORE token, as well as familiar collaboration tools like Issues and Pull-Requests.
